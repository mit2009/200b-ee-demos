### Elephant's Bluetooth Distance Estimating Demo

Hello! This first demo is prepared for Elephant Team's Find the Bread. The code uses two 'Arduino Nano IOT 33', though it's likely the code also works on the 'Arduino Nano 33 BLE' if the previously mentioned Arduino flavor is sold out.

The 'central device' is the center loaf. The 'peripheral devices' are the slices of breads at the end.
