# 2.00b Electronic Demos
Hello! Here are a bunch of demos for 2.00b 2022 that will hopefully be helpful in making your toy! Feel free to contact #ask-the-tas on Slack or DM Victor directly if you have any questions! It's GO TIME!
## Team Specific Demos
### Elephant: Bluetooth Distance Estimating Demo

Prepared for Elephant Team's Find the Bread. The code uses two `Arduino Nano IOT 33`, though it's likely the code also works on the `Arduino Nano 33 BLE` if the previously mentioned Arduino flavor is sold out.

The 'central device' is the center loaf. The 'peripheral devices' are the slices of breads at the end.

This demo uses the `ArduinoBLE` library.

### Polar Bear: NRF24L01 Demo

A quick demo to show how to use the NRF24L01 and the reed switches to get the 'bump' sensor.

## General Helpful Demos
### Reed Switch Demo

A tiny demo based off of Arduino's example button press code to demonstrate how to use a reed switch! (Yes! it is basically just like a button.)
